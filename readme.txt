Responsi Blank Child Theme for developers who want to use the Responsi Default style but add custom css and php.

== Description ==

The Blank Child theme adds a style.css and functions.php file so that developers can add custom code to those files which won't be over written when the Framework is updated.

* Install at any time, no Responsi Framework settings will be over written
* Just for developers who are wanting to add custom stylesheets or functions to their theme.
* No Auto updates - the only code in this child theme is code that is added by the theme developer and hence that code should be maintained by the developer
